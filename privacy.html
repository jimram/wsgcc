          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>The Woodchurch Scout & Guide Community Centre (The Charity, we or us) cares about the privacy of your personal information and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy (Policy) explains what information we collect about you and why, what we do with that information, and how we handle that information.</p>
          <p>For the purposes of the applicable data protection laws (the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (GDPR), together with any implementing legislation, in particular, the Data Protection Act 2018), the company responsible for your personal information is The Charity. This Policy applies to information obtained by us through your use of the information and services made available through the woodchurchcommunitycentre.co.uk website (Website).</p>
          <h3>Collection of your Personal Information</h3>
          <p>The Charity collects information that, alone or in combination with other data, could be used to identify you (Personal Information), such as your e-mail address, name, physical address, telephone number, or employment information. If you make a purchase from The Charity, we will collect and store your billing and credit card information. The Charity may also collect anonymous demographic information which is not unique to you, such as your postal code and preferences (Non-Personal Information). Non-Personal Information is not linked to your Personal Information (for example, your IP address).</p>
          <p>The Charity will collect your Personal Information in a number of ways, including when you contact us through the Website, by telephone, post, e-mail or through the other means set out below.</p>
          <h3>Information you provide when making an enquiry</h3>
          <p>When you make a booking enquiry through our website, you voluntarily give us certain Personal Information, including your:</p>

            <li>Phone number</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Automatically collected information</h3>
          <p>When you visit our Website, we automatically collect information about your computer hardware and software such as your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, operating system, cookie information, referring website addresses, pages visited, links clicked, text entered, and Internet Service Provider. We analyse and use this information to better understand how our users use the service, to maintain and improve our service, and in some cases, to publicly disclose aggregated statistics regarding our services.</p>
          <h3>Use of your Personal Information</h2>
          <p>The Charity collects and uses your Personal Information as necessary and for our legitimate interests, including to:</p>

            <li>respond to requests for bookings.</li>
            <li>understand and improve how our users use and interact with our services.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Storage of Personal Information</h3>
          <p>Unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law, we will only hold your Personal Information on our systems for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Policy, or until you request that the information be deleted in accordance with your right of erasure (see "Your rights" section below).</p>
          <p>Even if we delete your Personal Information, we reserve the right to maintain a copy for legal, tax or regulatory purposes, but in such event, we will do so only as long as necessary to fulfil those legal, tax or regulatory purposes. Please contact info@woodchurchcommunitycentre.co.uk for more information.</p>
          <h3>Personal Information access and disclosure</h3>
          <p>Under certain circumstances, the Charity may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).</p>
          <h3>Use of cookies</h3>
          <p>The Website uses "cookies" to help you personalise your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed by us or our remarketing partners on your hard drive by a web page server. Our cookies do not run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to your computer.</p>
          <p>We use Analytical/performance cookies which allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around the Website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our Website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.</p>
          <p>If you want to check or change what types of cookies you accept, this can usually be done within your browser settings. Please note that third parties (including, for example, advertising networks and providers of external services like web traffic analysis services) may also use cookies, over which we have no control.</p>
          <h3>How to reject cookies</h3>
          <p>If you do not want to receive cookies, you can usually choose to opt-out by modifying your browser settings to decline them. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to access all or parts of, or to fully experience the interactive features of, The Charity services or web pages you visit.</p>
          <p>For more information generally on cookies, including how to disable them, please refer to aboutcookies.org. This site also provides details on how to delete cookies from your computer.</p>
          <h3>Data security and integrity</h3>
          <p>The Charity is committed to taking reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the Personal Information that we hold from misuse, loss, or unauthorised access. We do this by using a range of technical and organisational measures including measures to deal with any suspected data breach. If you suspect any misuse or loss or unauthorised access to your personal information, please let us know immediately.</p>
          <p>The Website is designed to secure the Personal Information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, with protections from unauthorised access, use or disclosure. When Personal Information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
          <p>However, while we do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of all data which is transmitted to the Website or to another website via the internet or similar connection. If we have given you (or you have chosen) a password to access certain areas of the Website, please keep this password safe.</p>
          <h3>Your rights</h3>
          <p>Under the GDPR, you have various rights in relation to your Personal Information, such as the rights of access, rectification, restriction, objection, portability, and erasure. Please note that these rights are subject to certain limitations set forth in applicable law.</p>
          <p>To exercise these rights, please contact info@woodchurchcommunitycentre.co.uk. We will seek to deal with your request without undue delay, and in any event in accordance with the requirements of applicable laws. Please note that we may keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues you raise.</p>
          <h3>Complaint resolution</h3>
          <p>If you believe that we have not complied with this Policy or your data protection rights, you have the right to file a complaint with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, however, we hope that you'll attempt to resolve the complaint with us first. Please contact us for more information.</p>
          <h3>Links to third-party websites</h3>
          <p>Our Website includes links to other websites whose privacy practices are not under The Charity’s control. If you submit Personal Information to any of those websites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy on any website that you visit.</p>
          <h3>Children</h3>
          <p>We do not intend to solicit or collect Personal Information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are under 18, do not enter information on this Website or engage our services. If you believe a child or yours under the age of 18 has entered Personal Information, please contact us to have the data removed and terminate the child's account.</p>
          <h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>
          <p>We will occasionally update this Policy to reflect company and customer feedback. The Charity encourages you to periodically review this Policy to be informed of how we are protecting your Personal Information.</p>
