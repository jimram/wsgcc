=================

Easy PHP Form to Email Script.

1. Create a html form with action pointing to the emailer.php file, and method="get". See example below:
	`<form method="get" action="emailer.php">
	</form>`

2. Create as many input fields as you want, each with a 'name' tag. See example:
	`<input name="Email" />`


3. Put a submit button on the form.

4. Modify the settings in settings.php (dumb-proof) and you're all set to go!
